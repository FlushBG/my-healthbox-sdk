**myHealthbox API v2.1** is distributed by [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/roblat/api/myhealthbox). It is an API that provides access to a huge database of medicines and healthcare products: over 3 million products available in 70 countries, with information accessible in 40 languages. It provides basic information for a product like name, active ingredients, dosage, ATC code and more. It also exposes documents, related to a product (i.e. Patient Information Leaflets, SmPC, etc.)

**myHealthbox SDK** is a user-friendly interface on top of **myHealthbox API**, that comes with a set of methods for easy access and configuration of the available endpoints. It is written entirely in TypeScript and packaged with its own types to improve the developer experience. It can be installed, configured and used in seconds.
