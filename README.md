## Description

It is an API that provides access to one of the largest databases of information on medicines and healthcare products: over 3 million products available in 70 countries, with information accessible in 40 languages. It provides basic information for a product like name, active ingredients, dosage, ATC code and more. It also exposes documents, related to a product (i.e. Patient Information Leaflets, SmPC, etc.)

**myHealthbox SDK** is a user-friendly interface on top of **myHealthbox API**, that comes with a set of methods for easy access and configuration of the available endpoints.
